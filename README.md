# Watch Marketplace

The preowned/secondary market for luxury watches is quite important to the survival of the primary luxury watch market because the secondary market provides accessibility and availability that the primary market is not able to provide. Luxury watches fall in 2 different categories and the secondary market plays a role in both situations:

1. Watches that are highly desirable and retain their value. In this case, authorized dealers don't always have the watches available to provide to their customers. Secondary market addresses this issue by providing availability of these watches (often times at a premium). 

2. Watches that are not highly desriable and lose their value right after purchase. In this case, authorized dealers have the inventory but rarely provide discounts. Secondary market addresses this issue by providing the same watches at a greater discount than the authorized dealers do (accessbility). 

In either case there needs to be a level of trust in the seconary market dealer. Trust is often best developed by crowdsourced customer feedback (like google reviews); however, currently there is no seconary watch marketplace that focuses on customer feedback design. 

I realized this design + functionality gap in all current secondary watch marketplaces and decided to create a prototype app that would address this issue.
